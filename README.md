![Fashion MNIST Kaggle](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/2243/3791/9384af51de8baa77f6320901f53bd26b/dataset-cover.png)

## Overview

This repository contains code for building a Fashion MNIST image classifier using TensorFlow. Fashion MNIST is a dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images of clothing items in 10 categories. The goal of this project is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify these clothing items.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akd6203/fashion_mnist.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fashion_mnist
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `Fashion_MNIST_Classification.ipynb` notebook.

4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to execute each code cell and train the model.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip.

2. **Import Libraries**: Import TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and other required libraries in your Python script or notebook.

3. **Import Dataset**: Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow's built-in dataset loader.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by normalizing the pixel values and converting labels to categorical format.

5. **Build the Classifier**: Create a neural network model using TensorFlow's Sequential API.

6. **Compile the Model**: Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric.

7. **Train the Model**: Feed the training data to the model and train it for a specified number of epochs.

8. **Evaluate the Model**: Test the trained model on the test dataset and evaluate its performance using accuracy metrics.

9. **Visualize Training Progress**: Plot the training history to visualize the model's performance over epochs.

10. **Make Predictions**: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data samples.
